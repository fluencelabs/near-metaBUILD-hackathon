# MetaBUILD Hackaton

Welcome to the MetaBUILD hackathon. We are excited to join our friends at NEAR to empower you to push the Web3 envelope over the next two months. This is a great opportunity to discover, learn, build and grow.  We are looking forward to support you in turning your ideas into decentralized realities.

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the Fluence peer-to-peer network host addressable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence platform allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and associated governance models.


## Challenges And Prices

Since the duration of this hackathon allows for the tackling of some serious ideas, we offer you an incremental path to challenges and prizes starting with a Beginner challenge all the way to and an Advanced challenge. We encourage you to compete for each challenge over the course of the hackathon. 


### Beginner's Challenge -- 10 x USD 150.00

Use Fluence and Aqua manage an NFT contract from deployment to operation. To this end:

1. Store the NEAR NFT contract Wasm file(s) on IPFS
2. Use Fluence and Aqua to deploy the contract from IPFS to the NEAR testnet
3. Use Fluence and Aqua to at least mint and transfer NFTs from your contract

In addition to the general resources provided below, have a look at these links to get you started quickly:

* [Fluence IPFS Integration](https://doc.fluence.dev/aqua-book/libraries/aqua-ipfs)
* [Near NFT contract](https://examples.near.org/NFT)


### IntermediateChallenge -- 1 x USD 1,000.00

It's time to reenergize the plain old NFT (PON) with dynamic metadata. Using Fluence and Aqua, design and implement a (sub-) protocol to create and manage dynamic NFTs deployed on NEAR chain using IPFS, Ceramic, Textile or a similar as your decentralized persistence layer. For example, consider a dynamic NFT representing a sports persona, stock (immutable), game or political election where event-driven data triggers updates to the NFT's metadata.


### Advanced Challenge -- 1 x USD 2,500.00

In the advanced category, we offer you multiple challenges. Pick one and make it yours.

#### NEAR Indexer

Use Fluence and Aqua to index NEAR on-chain events to a decentralized storage solution such as IPFS, Ceramic or Textile.

#### On-Chain Event Capture And Processing

Use Fluence to capture NEAR on-chain events to trigger off-chain Aqua scripts to drive Oracles, dynamic NFTs or DAO executables.

#### Managed DAO

Use Fluence and Aqua to create and manage a Sputnik V2 DAO for a dynamic NFT project, e.g., repo. We are particularly interested in seeing you tackle efficient off/on-chain separation for proposals and votes using decentralized storage solutions such as IPFS.

### Submission Requirements

* Generously document your submission
* Provide a max three (3) minute video for Beginner challenges and a max five (5) minute video for intermediate and advanced challenges to present and demonstrate your solution 
* Submit via a Github or GitLab repo with MIT or Apache 2.0 license 

Judging is based on originality, functionality and completeness of the submission. In the case of multiple prizes for a given challenge, the order of submissions determines payout rank for complete and functional projects.
